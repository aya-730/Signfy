# Signfy
# Signfy harnesses the NSLT (Neural Sign Language Translation) model to recognize and convert sign language gestures into readable text. Additionally, I implemented an avatar that translates text back into sign language, ensuring bi-directional communication for both hearing and non-hearing individuals.

Technology Stack
Frontend: I developed the front end with Flutter, chosen for its versatility across platforms. This enables Signfy to run seamlessly on both mobile devices and web browsers, enhancing accessibility and user convenience.
Backend: I used Django to build a robust and scalable backend, managing data processing, model integration, and API development.
